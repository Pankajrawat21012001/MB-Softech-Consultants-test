            <p>The move comes after nearly two years since PayPal enabled users to buy and sell crypto on its platform.
            </p>
            <p>After rolling out the ability to buy and sell crypto on its platform in October 2020, PayPal is finally
              allowing users the ability to natively transfer, send and receive digital assets between PayPal and other
              wallets and exchanges. As of Tuesday, the feature is available to select U.S. users, with the feature
              expanding to all eligible U.S. users in the coming weeks. The first batch of supported coins consists of
              Bitcoin <strong>BTC </strong>
              <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price" style="color:green;text-decoration: none;">$16,704</a>,
              Ether
              <strong>ETH</strong> <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"
                style="color:green;text-decoration: none;">$1217</a>, Bitcoin Cash <strong>BCH</strong>

              <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-cash-price-index"
                style="color:green;text-decoration: none;">$100</a>, and Litecoin <strong>LTC</strong> <a
                href="https://cointelegraph.com/ltc-price-index" style="color:green;text-decoration: none;">$74.58</a>.
              In addition, customers who transfer their crypto onto PayPal can
              spend it via Checkout at millions of
              merchant terminals. The company has been granted a full Bitlicense by the New York Department of Financial
              Services for the conduct.
            </p>
            <p> Users would simply need to log in to their accounts and enter the crypto section of the application to
              start
              transferring coins. Users are generally required to complete a one-time ID verification before the
              procedure.</p>
            <p>Crypto transfers to recipients outside of PayPal would incur a network fee based on their respective
              blockchains, but transfers between PayPal users will not incur such fees. To protect users' privacy, the
              firm generates a new recipient address for each transaction into one's PayPal account. PayPal will also
              not
              charge fees for incoming transfers,</p>
            <p>The company is also working to integrate other forms of cryptocurrency services, such as central bank
              digital currencies, to boost its digital footprint. It is also exploring the possibility of launching its
              own stablecoin, dubbed "PayPal Coin." The discovery came after a developer found evidence of such a
              stablecoin within the source code of the company's iPhone app</p>

            <p>Crypto traders in Italy will be subject to a 26% capital-gains tax starting in 2023, according to a new
              budget that won parliamentary approval on Thursday.
              Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's 2023 expansionary budget – which was completed in a rush before
              the end of the year – features 21 billion euros ($22.3 billion) in tax breaks to assist businesses and
              households facing the energy crisis, Reuters <a

                style="color:green;text-decoration: none;">remains largely unregulated</a>, the 387-page budget
              legitimizes crypto assets by
              defining them as "a digital representation of value or rights, which can be transferred and stored
              electronically, using the technology of distributed ledger or similar technology."</p>
            <p>Italy's (and most recently <a

              implementation of the European Union's <a

              bloc.</p>
            <p>The 26% rate applies to gains from crypto trading if they exceed 2,000 euros per tax period. As an
              incentive for declaring crypto profits, the new bill also sets a "substitute income tax" for investors at
              14% of the value of the assets held as of Jan. 1, 2023, instead of the cost at the time of purchase.

              forward.</p>
            <p>Investors, however, may require some additional guidance on what qualifies as a taxable event as the
              document also says, "the exchange between crypto assets having same characteristics and functions,"

            <p>2022 has been a rough and tough year for investors, traders, cryptocurrency businesses, and miners in
              general. The prolonged bear market, exacerbated by a series of catastrophic events, posed a threat to
              miners.</p>
            <p>Miners were dealing with a variety of issues, including defaulted loans, quarterly losses, and soaring
              bitcoin hash rates that reached all-time highs. All these factors were affecting the profitability of the
              miners and were causing sell pressure.</p>
            <p>The situation was aggravated when cryptocurrency prices, including Bitcoin’s, plummeted. Bitcoin, which
              was hovering around $48,000 last year, hit a low of $15,590 by the end of 2022. According to the data
              collected from The Block, bitcoin miners’ revenue hit $9.55 billion in 2022.</p>
            <p><strong>Bitcoin miners’ revenue dropped in 2022</strong></p>
            <p>Bitcoin, which is trading at $16,721 at press time, has been on a downward spiral alongside other
              cryptocurrencies. The falling cryptocurrency prices had a major effect on the income and profits of
              miners. Even though the $9.55 billion in revenue in 2022 seems like a large number, it is comparatively
              lower than that of 2021.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Over the course of 2021, bitcoin miners made more thqan $15 billion in revenue, according to the data
              from the block. This was actually considered to be a 206% year-over-year increase.</p>
